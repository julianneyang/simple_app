Assays,,
"These mice were on an HFD for 12 weeks, were weighed and % body fat percentage measured every week, underwent a GTT between week 11 and 12, and then were fasted for 12 hours overnight prior to gavaging with FITC dextran and sacking 4 hours post gavage",,
Mucosal pellets were collected in DMEM/DTT (no FBS) in the same manner as was done for GPX mice,,
